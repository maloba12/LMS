Title: Replace CV Upload With Payslip Upload in Loan Application Workflow

Objective:
Modify the existing Loan Management System to replace the "Upload CV" requirement with a "Upload Payslip" requirement during loan application. The payslip will be used to validate income, repayment ability, and employment details.

Scope of Work:
1. Remove all CV-upload related fields, validations, API references, database columns, labels, and UI text.
2. Introduce a new "Payslip Upload" component supporting PDF, PNG, and JPEG formats.
3. Add validation rules:
   - Maximum file size: 5MB
   - Allowed formats: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG
   - Prevent empty submission
4. Backend Requirements:
   - Create/modify file storage path for payslips
   - Update loan application model to store payslip metadata (filename, path, size, MIME type, upload timestamp)
   - Ensure secure storage and access control with role-based permissions
5. UI Requirements:
   - Replace “Upload CV” label with “Upload Latest Payslip (last 3 months preferred)”
   - Add tooltip: “Your payslip is used to assess affordability and eligibility.”
6. Security & Compliance:
   - Encrypt stored file references
   - Ensure payslip cannot be downloaded by other users
   - Mask sensitive identifiers when previewing
7. Impacted Areas:
   - Loan Application Form
   - Application Review Page (Admin and Vendor)
   - Database schema
   - API endpoints for document upload
8. Acceptance Criteria:
   - CV option fully removed from all modules
   - Payslip successfully uploaded and linked to loan application
   - Attempting to submit without payslip triggers validation error
   - Admin/vendor can view payslip document securely
