PROJECT NAME: Loan Management System (Next.js + MySQL)

PROJECT GOAL: Build a functional loan management web application using Next.js (App Router) and MySQL. The system must support customer onboarding, CV/document upload, loan application submission, loan status tracking, and an admin dashboard for managing users and loan applications.

TECH STACK:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Next.js API Routes

Database: MySQL

Authentication: Email + Password (hashed)

File Uploads: Local file storage with DB references

Environment: Linux + MySQL

USER ROLES:

Customer

Admin

CUSTOMER FEATURES:

View loan application status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)

View uploaded documents

ADMIN FEATURES:

Secure admin login

View all registered users

APPLICATION STRUCTURE (Next.js App Router):

app/page.js → Landing page

app/auth/login/page.js → Login page

app/auth/register/page.js → Registration page

app/dashboard/customer/page.js → Customer dashboard

app/dashboard/admin/page.js → Admin dashboard

app/api/auth → Authentication APIs

app/api/loans → Loan CRUD APIs

app/api/users → User management APIs

app/api/upload → File upload APIs

ARCHITECTURE RULES:

Use Server Components for data fetching and DB operations

Use Client Components ("use client") for forms, state, and interactions

Separate concerns: UI logic vs API logic

Use environment variables for DB credentials

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:

Hash passwords using bcrypt

Validate user input

Restrict file uploads by type and size

Protect admin routes by role-based access

DELIVERABLE:

Functional MVP

Clean project structure
